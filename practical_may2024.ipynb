    "\n",
    "## Spectral Networking - A means of organizing and visualizing abstract spectral data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical we will delve deeper into computational metabolomics toolkit in the form of mass spectral molecular networking. Mass spectral networking, also known as molecular networking, is a staple method used by untargeted metabolomics researchers to help in exploratory data analysis and presentation of their results. Networks serve to organize the data, find connections between different spectra, and assist in propagating structural information to and from neighboring nodes. In addition, spectral feature groups, also known as molecular families, often serve as a canvas for overlaying annotation information to be presented in scientific papers and presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spectral Networking - Spectral and Structural Similarity Link\n",
    "\n",
    "On a conceptual level, molecular networking inverts the observation that similar structures tend to fragment similarly into the reverse hypothesis that similar spectra imply similar structures. This inversion opens up a way to organize unknown spectra into groups with implied structural overlaps. While we may not know the chemical identity of the grouped spectra, we do know that their spectral similarity implies a certain structural similarity. It is important to take into account that we may have library matches or high confidence structural annotations for at least some of the features, rendering the the molecular families a promising stepping stone into comparative spectral analysis with the purpose of structural elucidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spectral Networking - Data Processing and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "On a technical level molecular networking can be perceived as a two-step data processing and data visualization workflow. In the data processing step, spectra data are turned into a pairwise similarity matrix based on the modified cosine score, which is turned into a collection of subnetworks using various topological settings among which :\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **spectral similarity thresholds**: a minimum pairwise similarity cutoff value required before a connection (edge, link) between spectra is made. This limits connectivity to promising pairwise relationships and prevents visual overload from excess connections. \n",
    "+ **minimum fragment overlaps**: a minimum number for the number of shared fragments between a pair of spectra before it is considered for connection. This limits connectivity to promising pairwise relationships and prevents visual overload from excess connections. \n",
    "+ **maximum node degree**: a maximum number of connections to a given feature, used primarily to prevent visual clutter from excessive numbers of edges for certain nodes.\n",
    "+ **maximum sub-network size**: a limit on the number of members within a molecular family; essentially a limitation to cluster size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The molecular networking workflow makes use of these setting to generate a collection of disjoint sub-networks from the full data. These sub-networks, of which some will inevitably be singletons (single features disconnected from everything else), are visualized all-together (side-by-side) or group-wise as network diagrams (also known as Node-Link or Vertex-Edge diagrams) in Cytoscape. Somewhat misleadingly, molecular networks in Cytoscape are organized by sub-network size, giving the misleading impression that larger clusters are more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spectral Networking - Data Subdivision & Structural Hypothesis Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral similarity groupings and their network visualization are useful for two primary reasons. First, they subdivide large heterogeneous datasets into smaller, more homogeneous and thus more manageable subsets. Dealing with small subnetworks and gaining an overview of the features within them is much more straightforward than dealing with a whole dataset at once.Second, the nodes within the groupings contain an implicit structural relationship with one another that may be useful for structural hypothesis generation. The latter part is especially useful in conjunction with library matches or high confidence annotations for some spectra."

    "##  Limitations of \"molecular networking\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While clearly advantageous and an important first step in generating organization in datasets, molecular networking and its subdivision into subnetworks does come with tradeoffs. Here, subdividing networks into strict subnetworks may obscure relationships between such subnetworks or across the spectra they contain. While strict edge cutoffs may be needed for organizing spectral data into disjoint groups using this method, they do represent a loss of topological neighborhood information. The feature grouping itself is done using a plethora of topological settings, and correspondingly difficult to tune. This is especially true when changing between different scoring approaches with different scoring behavior than the modified cosine score such as MS2DeepScore. Modified cosine scoring tends to produce sparse matrices suitable for disjoint subdivision, while machine learning embedding-based scores such as MS2DeepScore tend to create much higher interconnectivity between features, easily leading to dense hairball networks that are difficult to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to difficulties in finding the right settings to use, the molecular networking workflow comes in a blank canvas form; nodes and edges are shown, some metadata and annotation information is integrated, yet visual mappings are left to the user. Hence, a good understanding of the cytoscape user interface and its settings is required to achieve good visual integration of the type of information sought. As such, molecular networking is better viewed as a starting point for additional customization and data explorations rather than an exploratory end-point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following tasks we will make use of different approaches to generating molecular network-like visualizations interactively within this jupyter notebook. Specifically, we will explore a workflow similar to the one used in [specXplore](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c04444) and [msFeaST](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h7sm8), where two-dimensional embedding projections and interactive network overlays are used together."

    "The code produces a plot and tabular data output showing the perplexity value used against performance. Here, embedding performance is measured via the pairwise distance correlation (pearson or spearman) between the distances in the pairwise distance matrix compared to the euclidean distance between pairs in the t-SNE embedding. Ideally, the correspondence will be high, meaning that the two-dimensional projection does not lead to a large loss of information. In practice however, losses are expected, and higher scoring t-SNE embeddings may lead to incovenient projection artefacts when using a high score."

    "    Perplexity as a parameter roughly corresponds to the number of nearest neighbors considered in the t-SNE embedding. The pearson and spearman correlations should ideally be high, yet at the same time, the embedding should lead to good point clusters. Notice that high perplexity values improve the distance preservation. However, while this is the case, local grouping becomes poorer; while distance preservation overall gets a bonus from better global distance preservation, local distances preservation in the form of nearest neighbors can suffer. This is difficult to see in static represenations but becomes apparent when working with the network overlays below. In this practical, we stick to lower perplexity values as we would like to inspect local connectivity using network approaches.\n",

    "    High perplexity values lead to better global distance preservation. However, good global behavior distance preservation is often interfering with qualitative userful two dimensional embedding representation in the sense that clustering becomes apparent. In practice, t-SNE is an effective approach precisely because of its lack of focus on global distances, instead preserving local neighborhood clusters in its projection.

In the visualized example below many points are diffused into a large central structure, with a large number of points condensed into two ridges with high point density.\n",

    "    Fold change gives a measure of the relative increase of the intensity of a feature in one group compared to the other. If a feature is lowly present in OMSW0, and highly present in OMSW80, we will see large fold changes and be alerted to the respective treatment responsive chemicals for further inspection. This information is precursor-based and thus stands independent of the ms/ms fragmentation information we use to organize the spectra into groups of related compounds. Notice that fold-change has one issue: as a relative measure it deals poorly with 0 values. In fact, a number of features in the dataset are completely absent in one group but present in another, immediately leading to infinite fold changes. In addition, lowly abundant features in one group can quickly display very high fold changes as well. To deal with potentially out of bounds fold changes, the node_size column computed below limits the node size to 50 for high or infinite fold changes and is further based on log-fold change.\n",

To do this, we need to construct node and edge lists using the information produced above, i.e. t-SNE embedding informs the node positioning, k-medoid clustering informs node grouping, pairwise similarity informs node neighbors, and log2-fold-change informs node size. The network visualization does not make use of edge thresholds as done in molecular networking. Instead, the user can select the number of top-K most similar features / neighbors to be highlighted via edges for each node. This approach means that any node will have neighbors, albeit not necessarily very high scoring ones. For computational reasons, the maximum number of neighbors is capped at 50."

    "   This could be run but would lead to unintelligable hairball-networks. Molecular networking run without any threshold or top-K settings would lead to every feature being connected to every other feature. This would prevent establishing molecular familes, and would prevent any reasonable layout algorithm to work. The number of edges would also impact visualization readability and computational performance drastically. Using only top-K (in gnps with top-k overlap requirement) settings rather than threshold settings could work. However, the lack of adjustability or consideration of edge weight in layout generation would lead to difficult to read networks.\n",

    "    Setting a good quantitative threshold in molecular networking is difficult, but essential for the procedure to work. Quantitative thresholds in a static fashion can result in missing information about node and cluster connectivity. For example, more weakly connected nodes may end up as singletons. When used interactively as in specXplore, quantitative thresholds can still be hard to set, and easily lead to visual overload if used to liberally. The top-K approach is simple, adapts seamlessly to different similarity scores, and has the advantage of not leaving any singletons. For very low top-K values, it may also be useful for static network visualization. However, it is best used in dynamic settings and is less likely to provide easy to interpret disjoint clusters. Moreover, even the top-K most similar neighbors may be utterly unrelated, thus requiring careful edge interpretation when using it in practice.\n",
